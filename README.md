##  Description

you can find in my git the most important machine learning projects I worked on in my academic environment at the University of Paris Saclay.

## About Projects
you can find here a small summary of the projects without going into too much detail :

### - Naïve Bayes classifier Vs TreeAugmented Bayes classifier : 
In this project I studied an approach of two directed graphical models which are Naïve Bayes Classifier (NB) and Tree Augmented Naïve Bayes (TAN), study their points of similarity and difference, strengths, weaknesses and algorithmic complexity of each of them and at the end a numerical comparison in terms of predictive power of each model after applying them on the dataset.

### - Semi supervised learning and GANs Method
In this project, I present the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) method which is commonly used when there is not enough labeled data and its architecture for image classification.
My work is based on a method discussed in a scientific article for the construction of a semi-supervised classification model on the dataset.

### - Scooring method for the default of payment of the customers to their banks :
The work was done with two approaches, one with MLIB and the other with Pyspark in order to compare the results given by the two approaches.
It is a supervised learning problem which consists in predicting the probability of default by using different supervised learning algorithms (e.g. logistic regression ... etc).

### - Gaussian Process Regression for Derivative Portfolio Modeling and Application to CVA Computations
The goal of this project is to study a Gaussian process regression approach that is well suited to the valuation of OTC derivative portfolios involved in CVA (Credit Value Adjustment) calculations based on Stéphane Crépey and Matthew F. Dixon's paper entitled "Gaussian Process Regression for Derivative Portfolio Modeling and Applications to CVA Calculations".

you can find in detail the reports of these projects as well as the report of my internship (PFE) in the folder named `Project_Report`.
